# Fake\_Products\_Identification\_using\_Blockchain

## Description

This project aims to identify and verify the authenticity of products using blockchain technology. The goal is to ensure transparency and trust in the product supply chain by leveraging blockchainâ€™s immutable and decentralized nature. The system records product data at various stages of production and distribution, making it tamper-proof and easily verifiable by consumers.

## Tools and Technologies

* **Blockchain**: Used to store product data in a secure, decentralized ledger.
* **Ethereum**: The blockchain platform used for implementing smart contracts and decentralized applications.
* **Solidity**: Programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
* **Web3.js**: A JavaScript library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
* **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: For storing product-related files, such as images or documents, in a decentralized way.
* **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend server and interacting with Ethereum.
* **Truffle Suite**: A development framework for Ethereum applications to manage contracts and testing.
* **Metamask**: A browser extension to manage Ethereum accounts and interact with decentralized applications.

## Installations and Requirements

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fake_Products_identification_using_blockchain.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure that **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your machine. Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up the Blockchain

* Install **Truffle** globally for smart contract development:

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

* Set up your **Ethereum wallet** using **Metamask**.
* Deploy the smart contract using Truffle with the following command:

```bash
truffle migrate --network development
```

### 4. Set up IPFS (optional)

If you need to store product-related files using IPFS, install the IPFS client:

```bash
npm install ipfs-http-client
```

### 5. Run the Application

To start the application server, use:

```bash
npm start
```

### 6. Access the Application

Open your browser and visit the local server (usually `http://localhost:3000`) to interact with the application.

## Requirements

* **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
* **Metamask** browser extension
* **Truffle** framework for smart contract deployment
* **Ganache** (for local Ethereum blockchain testing)
* **IPFS** (optional, for decentralized file storage)
